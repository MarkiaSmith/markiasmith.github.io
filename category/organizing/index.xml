      <description>&lt;p&gt;**Building Relationships to Diversify Graduate Education
**
Founded in 2019 by UNC-CH doctoral student Taylor Y. Dismuke, BRDGE Alliance was designed to be a STEM mentoring program with a goal to bridge the gap​ between underrepresented minorities and the STEM community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current focus of BRDGE Alliance is to develop undergraduate students at Historically Black colleges and universities by creating dynamic relationships with black graduate students at research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim to improve diversity in STEM we will use application of peer mentorship, community, and personal and professional development activities to develop underrepresented students in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;
